			<p>
				We wish to bring to your kind notice that for promoting the campus
				employment opportunies for students of the Engineering Colleges,
				located in rural areas, we have formed a joint understnding with
				many other institutions on full commitment basis. This association
				is called "ACCESS"- ASSOCIATION OF ENGINEERING COLLEGES FOR THE
				JOINT CAMPUS EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND SELECTIONS, with its
				headquarters in our Campus. Through this association we can organize
				pool recruitment drives with large footfall as per the requirement.
				<br>
				<br> We strongly believe that the placement process is not just
				a yearly affair, but is an on-going relationship between an
				Institute and the organization. I would like to thank the industry
				for its kind patronage and successful associations with us year
				after year and look forward to similar 'tie-ups' in future.
